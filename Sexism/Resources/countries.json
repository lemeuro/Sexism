On 6 April 2016, the French National Assembly voted to punish customers of prostitutes by a fine of â‚¬1500. The law has been evaluated as a failure, putting sex workers in danger, reducing prices, and decreasing condom use among their clients. In the Napoleonic era, France became the model for the regulatory approach to prostitution. In the 20th century, however, a policy shift became apparent. Brothels became illegal in 1946, and France signed the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others in 1960. France thus became a major supporter of the international abolitionist movement for the eradication of prostitution.",

A 2008 report stated that were some 100,000 prostitutes in Italy. In 2007 it was stated that the total number of workers was 70,000. The Italian Statistics Institute stated the number of street workers in 1998 was 50,000. A euphemism often used to refer to prostitutes in Italy is Lucciole (lit. 'fireflies')",
